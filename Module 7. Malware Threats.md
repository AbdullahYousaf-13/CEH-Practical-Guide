## Malware Threats
With the help of a malicious application (malware), an attacker gains access to stored passwords in a computer and is able to read personal documents, delete files, display pictures or messages on the screen, slow down computers, steal personal information, send spam, and commit fraud. Malware can perform various malicious activities that range from simple email advertising to complex identity theft and password stealing.

#### Objective
Understand how malware functions, its purposes, and the potential damage it can cause to individuals and organizations.

#### Approach
Analyze malware behavior in a controlled lab environment using tools like Flare VM to study infection methods, propagation, and impact.
