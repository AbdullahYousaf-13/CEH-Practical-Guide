# Module 6

## System Hacking
The ethical hacking phase where testers exploit vulnerabilities to obtain unauthorized entry into systems, demonstrating potential real-world attack paths.

**Objective**: Simulate how an attacker would exploit vulnerabilities to demonstrate risk.

**Approach**: Done only in lab environments or with explicit permission.

**Steps involved**:
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities (using tools like Metasploit).
- Password attacks (brute-force, dictionary, credential stuffing).
- Exploiting misconfigurations (weak services, unpatched systems).
- Social engineering (phishing, malicious payloads).
