# Module 5

## Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability assessments identify and classify security weaknesses in systems, networks, and communication channels. They detect issues including missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, and weak encryption. These assessments help security professionals address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

#### Objective
Extract target system information such as:
- Network vulnerabilities
- Open IP ports and listening TCP/UDP services
- Application and service configuration errors
- Operating system versions
- Installed applications
- Accounts with weak passwords
- Files and folders with weak permissions
- Default services requiring removal
- Security misconfigurations
- Systems exposed to known vulnerabilities

#### Key Activities
- Gather vulnerability data using online sources and tools
- Identify weaknesses in current security mechanisms
- Evaluate effectiveness of additional security measures
- Provide actionable security insights

### 1. Perform Vulnerability Research with Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases
Vulnerability research provides awareness of advanced techniques to identify flaws or loopholes in the software that could be exploited.

#### 1.1 CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- A category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  
- Used as a baseline for identification, mitigation, and prevention.  
- Provides advanced search by research, development, and architectural concepts.  

**Steps:**
1. Launch any web browser, and go to **https://cwe.mitre.org/** website (here, we are using **Mozilla Firefox**).
2. **CWE** website appears. Navigate to **Search** tab, in the **Google Custom Search** under **CWE List Quick Access** section and search for **SMB** in the search field.
3. The search results appear, scroll-down to view the underlying vulnerabilities in the target service (here, **SMB**). You can click any link to view detailed information on the vulnerability.
4. Now, click any link (here, **CWE-284**) to view detailed information about the vulnerability.
5. Similarly, you can click on other vulnerabilities and view detailed information.
6. Now, navigate to the **CWE List** tab. **CWE List Version** will be displayed. Scroll down, and under the **External Mappings** section, select **CWE Top 25 (2023)**.
7. A webpage appears, displaying **CWE VIEW: Weaknesses in the 2023 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses**. Scroll down and view the list. You can check each weakness to view detailed information.

#### 1.2 CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- Provides standardized identifiers for known vulnerabilities.  
- Helps track and reference security issues across tools and databases.  

[CVE Website](https://cve.mitre.org/)

#### NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- U.S. government repository of vulnerability management data.  
- Includes CVE entries with severity metrics (CVSS scores).
