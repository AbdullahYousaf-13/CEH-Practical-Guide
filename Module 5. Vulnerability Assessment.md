## Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability assessments identify and classify security weaknesses in systems, networks, and communication channels. They detect issues including missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, and weak encryption. These assessments help security professionals address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

#### Objective
Extract target system information such as:
- Network vulnerabilities
- Open IP ports and listening TCP/UDP services
- Application and service configuration errors
- Operating system versions
- Installed applications
- Accounts with weak passwords
- Files and folders with weak permissions
- Default services requiring removal
- Security misconfigurations
- Systems exposed to known vulnerabilities

#### Key Activities
- Gather vulnerability data using online sources and tools
- Identify weaknesses in current security mechanisms
- Evaluate effectiveness of additional security measures
- Provide actionable security insights
