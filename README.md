### Footprinting & Reconnaissance Overview

#### Purpose:

Gather target information (organization, network, systems) to assess security risks, simulating attacker methods for proactive defense.

- **Active:** Engage with the target (e.g., DNS queries, network scanning).

#### Key Objectives:

- Map the organizationâ€™s digital footprint (domains, IPs, employees, tech stack).

- Identify vulnerabilities in publicly accessible data.

#### Use Case:

After a past breach, an ethical hacker performs footprinting to uncover exposed customer data and harden defenses.

#### Lab Goal:

Extract target details (network, systems, employee info) using open-source tools.
