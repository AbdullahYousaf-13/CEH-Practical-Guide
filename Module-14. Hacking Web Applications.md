## Hacking Web Applications
Web application hacking exploits vulnerabilities in apps via HTTP by manipulating logic, URIs, or HTTP elements. Common attacks include SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, brute-force, and parameter tampering. Ethical hackers/pen testers test these flaws to secure applications.

**Objectives**
- Understand web application vulnerabilities.
- Learn common attack techniques (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, brute-force).
- Perform security assessments to identify and fix flaws.

**Approach**
- Analyze HTTP requests, URIs, and inputs.
- Simulate attacks using practical labs/tools.
- Identify weaknesses and recommend security measures.
