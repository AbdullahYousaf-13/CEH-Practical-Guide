### 1. Perform Social Engineering using tools
In a social engineering test, you should try to trick the user into disclosing personal information such as credit card numbers, bank account details etx.

- launch SET
  - sudo su
  - setoolkit
- Select social engineering toolkit > website attack vectors > credential harvestor > site cloner
- As soon as the victim types in his/her Username and Password and clicks Login, SET extracts the typed credentials. These can now be used by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victimâ€™s account.
